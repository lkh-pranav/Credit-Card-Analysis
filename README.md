# Credit-Card-Analysis
## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.
This project aims to analyze weekly credit card transaction data coupled with customer information to achieve the following objectives:

•	Measure KPI’s : To measure and analyze various aspects of credit card data such as Revenue generated, transaction volume, Total Interest earned, Delinquency Rate, Customer Acquisition Cost, Customer Satisfaction score . By monitoring these KPIs, businesses can assess their performance, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to drive growth and profitability.

•	Revenue Analysis by Quarter, Week, and Month: Conduct analysis of revenue generated from credit card transactions, segmented by quarters, weeks, and months. This analysis aims to uncover revenue trends, seasonality effects, and fluctuations in customer spending patterns over time.


•	Customer Spending Habits and Card Category Analysis: Explore customer spending behaviors and preferences across different card categories (eg, gold, platinum) and expenditure types (eg, Bills, Entertainment, travel). By analyzing transaction data, businesses can gain insights into customer demographics, purchasing preferences, and spending patterns.

•	Customer Analysis based on Different Metrics: Analyze Revenue based on different customer information metrics such as Educational level, Customer Job type, Income group. 

•	Week-on-Week Revenue Comparison: Perform week-on-week revenue comparisons to identify trends, anomalies, and deviations from expected revenue patterns. By analyzing week-on-week revenue fluctuations, businesses can detect seasonal trends, promotional effects, and emerging market dynamics. This analysis enables proactive decision-making and timely interventions to capitalize on revenue opportunities or mitigate risks.

## SOFTWARE USED

•	PostgreSQL

•	Power BI

## DATA UNDERSTANDING  

Source: Kaggle

There are 2 datasets in (.csv) format which contain detailed information on Credit card Transaction and Customer information. The data spans a period of one year, from January 2023 to December 2023 and has about 10,293 records.

## CREATING DATABASE

•	Crafting a data repository within the framework of PostgreSQL,

•	Building tables for both Transaction and Customer data within the database

## IMPORTING DATA INTO DB

Bringing raw csv data into the PostgreSQL database by slotting it into the tables that have created.

## CONNECTING DB WITH POWER BI

Linking PostgreSQL database directly to Power BI in order to easily visualize and analyze the data in real-time.

## DATA CLEANING & TRANSFORMATION

This involves cleaning the data to remove any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values, standardizing formats, and ensuring data integrity. Additionally, data is aggregated and transformed as needed to facilitate analysis and using DAX queries to calculate important metrics and KPI’s such as Total revenue, Total transactions, and Week-on-Week change in revenue, Average utilization ratio, Customer Acquisition cost etc,.. Once cleaned and structured, the prepared data will serve as the foundation for building Dashboard

In Power query editor,

•	Reviewing each column in both tables to get a good grasp of the data and understand its context within the domain. No missing values or inconsistencies were detected ensuring reliability and accuracy in the dataset. 

•	Introducing a comprehensive metric named Revenue, which consolidates Transaction Amount, Interest Earned, and Annual Fees Charged into a single aggregated column which helps in keeping an overview of the financial performance.

[ *Note*: The above formula is used due to limited info on credit card details. The actual formula to calculate total revenue for a credit card company involves summing up the revenue from various sources:
 Total Revenue = Interest Income + Annual Fee Revenue +  Transaction Fee Revenue + Late Fee Revenue + Interchange   Fee Revenue + Cash Advance Fee Revenue ]

•	Implementing a new column, ‘week_num’, which is extracted from the ‘week_start_date’ column that denotes the week number within the year, helps in sorting the columns chronologically.

•	Introducing a new column, ‘Age group’, designed to categorize customers in ‘customer_age’ column into age buckets using ‘SWITCH’ function. By segmenting customers based on age, this addition helps in the analytical process, enabling to uncover trends and patterns more effectively.

•	Introducing the ‘Income group‘ column, used to categorizes customers based on their income levels using ‘SWITCH’ function that helps in analysis. By segmenting customers into income groups, we can gain deeper insights into their purchasing behaviors, preferences, and profitability.

•	Created DAX queries to measure the total revenue generated from credit card transactions within the current week and also within the previous week using CALCULATE function in order to find the Week-on-Week change in revenue.

•	Calculate Week-on-Week Change in Revenue using DIVIDE function, this measure calculates the percentage change in revenue from the previous week to the current week. It computes the difference between the current week revenue and the previous week revenue, then divides it by the previous week revenue.

•	Created a KPI, Total Customer Acquisition Cost(CAC) which  refers to the total cost a company incurs to acquire a new customer. It's a critical metric for businesses, including credit card companies, as it helps in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of their marketing and sales efforts.

•	Created a new metric, Average Utilization ratio(AU Ratio) which refers to the average percentage of credit card limits that are being used by cardholders. It's an important metric for credit card issuers to understand how much of their available credit card limits are being utilized by customers.

•	Created a new measure Delinquency Rate, A delinquent account in the context of credit card companies refers to an account on which the cardholder has failed to make the minimum required payment by the due date specified in the credit card agreement. When an account becomes delinquent, it can lead to various consequences such as late fees, increased interest rates, negative impact on credit scores, and potentially collections efforts by the credit card issuer.
